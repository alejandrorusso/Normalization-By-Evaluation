===========================

Formalization of normalization by evaluation for the fine-grained call-by-value language (FGCBV) extended with algebraic effect theories.


   ValueEffectTheoryVersion
     
      - The normalization by evaluation algorithm and the extension of value and effect theories to FGCBV_eff.


   EqualityVersion 
    
      - The version of normalization by evaluation where the value and effect theories do not contain any equations.
