Normalization-By-Evaluation
===========================

Formalization of normalization by evaluation for a fine-grained call-by-value language extended with algebraic effects.


   AlgebraicSignaturesVersion
     
      - The normalization by evaluation algorithm for a language extended with simple algebraic signatures (no equations, no parameters)


   ParametersEquationsPERsVersion 
    
      - The version of normalization by evaluation for a language extended with parametrized algebraic signatures and equations. Normalization finds normal forms up-to PERs.
      
      
   StateNormalizationVersion
   
      - The version of normalization by evaluation for a language extended with algebraic operations for global state. Normalization finds canonical normal forms (the state theory gets normalized).
